/// filled with data, a region that has been initialized at some point but not
/// yet logically filled, and a region at the end that may be uninitialized.
/// The filled region is guaranteed to be a subset of the initialized region.
///

/// region, since it is merely unknown whether this region is uninitialized or
/// not, and if part of it turns out to be initialized, it must stay initialized.
